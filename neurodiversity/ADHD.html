                <p>ADHD is not a disease! ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) is a neurodevelopmental
                    neurotype that is recognised by a lack of neurotransmitters in the brain, as well as a chemical called dopamine. 
                    This is often reflected through a person’s inability to regulate their attention span, memory, motivation or interest in tasks. 
                    This can lead to the unbalanced completion of activities and cognitive processes. It’s basically all or
                    nothing; hyperfocus or zero focus. This can also sometimes result in impulsive decision-making or
                    actions. ADHD can occur in children, (both boys and girls) as well as adults.</p>

                <h2>Different Types of ADHD</h2>
            </a>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Experiences can vary for any ADHDer, especially since there’s more than one type of ADHD.  
                    The several types are: one being hyperactive ADHD, where the person tends to be physically more hyperactive and energetic. 
                    This may present as constant talking, fidgeting and constantly being energetic, with a difficulty of sitting still for extended periods of time, 
                    as a need to move, expel pent up energy, or do something more stimulating, is often felt.
                    And the other most common one is inattentive ADHD (or ADD), where the person has a shorter or selective memory, polar attention span (they either
                    hyper-focus or find it almost impossible to focus), and usually have a hyperactive mind where their thoughts are
                    constantly racing around and they’re thinking of like a hundred different things at once, usually
                    making it hard to finish a train of thought.</p>
                <p> Now, the different types do overlap in some areas, yet are still considered to fit into one type or the other. But when the two overlap significantly, 
                    this is called combined ADHD. And combined ADHD, is where they are both inattentive, and hyperactive. For instance, someone might be inattentive with a polar
                     attention span, and selective memory, but also
                    physically
                    hyperactive, tending to be energetic and talkative.</p>

                <h2>Common ADHD Types in Boys and Girls</h2>
            </a>
            <div class="content">
                <p>ADHD, where you have physical hyperactivity, is more common in boys. Whereas in girls, the
                    inattentive type of ADHD is more common. But this does not mean that a girl
                    can’t have hyperactive ADHD and a boy can't have inattentive ADHD; every brain is different (whether
                    it’s neurodivergent or neurotypical), so just keep that in mind. ADHD in girls presents differently to ADHD in boys. 
                    ADHD in boys is usually more obvious as it's usually the hyperactive type, and therefore can be seen physically through fidgeting 
                    and non-stop energy. However, ADHD in girls is usually missed, as it's usually the inattentive type where it gets dismissed as them 
                    just being chatty, forgetful, a fidgeter, and a daydreamer. This tends to result in a lot of girls with ADHD being underdiagnosed, or being diagnosed later on in life. 
                    For children, boys are diagnosed with ADHD three times the rate that girls are. Researchers believe that this is because 
                    ADHD is more noticeable in boys, than it is in girls during childhood development. The gap between males and females in adult years 
                    though, is more balanced.</p>

                <h2>How does the ADHD brain work?</h2>
            </a>
            <div class="content">
                <p> There are a few things to note about the brain of an ADHDer, and the first is that people born with ADHD, have a natural lack of something called "neurotransmitters". 
                    A neurotransmitter is like a messenger in the brain, it allows the different parts of the brain to communicate with each other. But this lack of neurotransmitters in people with ADHD, means that sometimes different parts of their brain 
                    communicate a little slower, or a little differently to a neurotypical brain. 
                    Another thing to note about the wonderful ADHD brain, is that the prefrontal cortex plays significant role in the way that the brain works differently. But first, a quick biology crash course: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>The prefrontal cortex plays a particularly significant role in controlling cognitive abilities such
                        as working memory, emotional control, and complex problem-solving. 
                        </li>
                        <li>The abilities we all rely on to manage daily chores, such as time management, staying organised, and planning, are known as
                            executive functions.
                        </li>
                        <li>Although many different areas of the brain are involved in executive functioning, the prefrontal cortex plays a particularly significant role in controlling these
                            abilities.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            
                    In children who are ADHDers, the prefrontal cortex develops more slowly and is slightly smaller in
                    size.
                    Additionally, children who are ADHDers have reduced volumes of the cerebellum, hippocampus, and
                    amygdala.
                    The cerebellum has a variety of roles, but its ability to control movement may be particularly
                    relevant to the experiences of ADHD. A common experience of ADHDers, is a difference in the
                    regulation of memory, emotion, and behaviour, which can be brought on by a smaller hippocampus and amygdala.

                <h2>Debunking the “excuse” myth</h2>
            </a>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Over the years, as doctors and scientists have learned more about ADHD and what it entails, people
                    and society have gained a better understanding of what it actually is. Unfortunately, there are
                    still some ideas that ADHD is just an “excuse” to get out of doing things, or to be lazy. It’s also
                    thought of by some as a sign of a lack of intelligence, just because ADHDers, find it hard to
                    pay attention or retain things.
                    However, all of those ideas are completely false. There is scientific evidence and research
                    supporting the reasons behind the lack of attention and retention of information.
                </p>
                <p>And just because some people have difficulty paying attention or remembering things doesn’t mean that
                    they can’t learn or are limited in their learning. In fact, being an ADHDer, only opens up more
                    doors to
                    explore. ADHDers tend to process information slower than other people in order to
                    understand it at the level that is needed. And while this can sometimes be frustrating and take
                    time, it means that when going through something slowly, ADHDers can pick up on details
                    that are usually overlooked by others, or can make connections that are usually missed.
                    They don’t just look at a painting as a canvas with a picture on it; they look at a painting as
                    layers and layers of different coloured paint on a woven canvas stretched over its wooden
                    frame. Each brush stroke, each shade of paint, and the way it’s been placed onto the canvas. They
                    can see every detail in a picture and then pull it all together to not just get the “bigger
                    picture”, but to get a masterpiece. Below are a few strengths that ADHDers usually have:
