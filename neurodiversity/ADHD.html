        <h1>ADHD (Attention Defecit Hyperactivity Disorder)</h1>

            </a>
            <div class="content">

                <p> ADHD is not a disease! ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) is a neurodevelopmental
                    neurotype that is recognised by a person’s lack of neurotransmitters in their brain, as well as a
                    natural brain chemical called dopamine.</p>
                    
                <p>The result of these unique characterisitcs of the brain, is shown through ADHDers usually having the
                    inability to regulate their attention span, as well as working memory, motivation and interest.
                    Having a natural lack of dopamine, a brain chemical and neurotransmitter (as well as some other
                    things going on in the prefrontal cortex), can lead to the
                    unbalanced completion of activities and cognitive processes. This might look like starting a problem
                    with great interest and high motivation, and then
                    losing all intertest and motivation half-way through. Or maybe not being able to focus in class, but
                    at home, focus on the home work or on a
                    personal project for hours at a time, without getting distracted once.</p>

                <p>This behaviour of focusing for hours on end and not giving in to distraction,
                    is called hyperfocus, and it's apart of the difficulties of regulating an attention span. But it
                    sure comes in handy for cramming before a test! Not that I recommend it.</p>
                    
                <p>So, it's basically all or nothing; hyperfocus or zero focus. ADHDers can also sometimes experience
                    impulsive decision-making or actions, whether that be
                    impulse purchasing, impuslive decisions in a tricky situation or fight, etc. ADHD can occur in
                    children (both boys and girls), as well as adults.

                <h2>Different Types of ADHD</h2>
            </a>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Experiences can vary for any ADHDer, especially since there are several types of ADHD. There are two
                    distinct types of ADHD
                    (hyperactive or inattentive), but they can overlap in some areas, and when they overlap
                    significantly, we get something called "combined ADHD".
                    So, to give you a bit more info, here are the three types of ADHD, and what they usually entail:
                <ul>
                    <li>Number #1 - Hyperactive ADHD, is the least-common type, and it's where the person tends to be
                        more physically hyperactive.
                        And this can be seen through fidgeting, non-stop energy and impulsive and hyperactive
                        behaviours.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Number #2 - Inattentive ADHD (or ADD),
                        where the person has a shorter or selective memory, polar attention span (they either
                        hyper-focus or find it almost impossible to focus), and have what I like to call a
                        "racing-mind", where their thoughts are
                        constantly racing around, thinking of like a hundred different things at once. 
                        <br>
                        This usually makes it hard to finish a train of thought, and it can result in being very talkative as they
                        try to get all their ideas and thoughts out at once, or being very quiet as they are so immersed in their busy mind.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Number #3 - Combined ADHD, or co-occurring ADHD, is the most common type of ADHD, and it's where
                        the two types of inattentive and hyperactive overlap significantly,
                        and result in the ADHDer experiencing traits that are found on both hyperactive ADHD and
                        inattentive ADHD. 
                        <br>
                        For example, someone with combined ADHD might be hyperactive with fidgeting, and non-stop energy, but might also have
                        a really short attention span as they try to focus, but their brain just wants to turn to something more stimulating whether it
                        be a physical activty or a topic that generates more interest.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common ADHD Types in Boys and Girls</h2>
            </a>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Boys and girls can both have ADHD, but in most cases, they is a certain type of ADHD that is shown
                    more in one gender, than the other.
                    <br>
                    Hyperactive ADHD and Combined ADHD, are 2 to 3 times more common in boys. Whereas in girls,
                    Inattentive ADHD is more common (but this
                    does not mean that a girl can’t have hyperactive ADHD and a boy can't have inattentive ADHD; every
                    brain is different).</p>
                    
                 <p>Unfortunately, this has developed a misguided idea that boys are more likely to have ADHD since the
                    common ADHD type (hyperactive) in boys is presented more physically and therefore easier to pickup and 
                    diagnose, while the Inattentive type which is common in girls, has more internalised symptoms.
                    This then leads to a misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis in girls with ADHD,
                    which has lead to the average age of seven for boys to with ADHD to be diagnosed, while most girls
                    and women struggle with a lack of support and diagnosis,
                    or being misdiagnosed, until they, on average receive a correct diagnois for ADHD in their thirties
                    or fourties.</p>
                    
                <p>But this can change, by raising awareness about ADHD and educating people on it and how it presents differently, ADHD in girls can be
                    recognised and diagnosed a lot sooner, resulting in a life where they have the
                    support they need and are given the chances they deserve to excel in areas of life and school just like their peers.

            </a>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The prefrontal cortex plays a particularly significant role in controlling cognitive abilities such
                    as working memory, emotional control, and complex problem-solving. The abilities we all rely on to
                    manage daily chores, such as time management, staying organised, and planning, are known as
                    executive functions.</p>
                    
                <p>In children who are ADHDers, the prefrontal cortex develops more slowly and is slightly smaller in
                    size. Additionally, children who are ADHDers have reduced volumes of the cerebellum, hippocampus, and amygdala.

                <h2>Debunking the “dumb” myth</h2>
            </a>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Over the years, as doctors and scientists have learned more about ADHD and what it entails, people
                    and society have gained a better understanding of what it actually is. Unfortunately, there are
                    still some ideas that ADHD is just an “excuse” to get out of doing things, to be lazy, or that
                    people with ADHD are less intelligent and unable to learn.
                    <br>
                    However, all of those ideas are completely false. There is scientific evidence and research
                    supporting the reasons behind the lack of attention and retention of information.
                </p>
                <p>Just because ADHDers have difficulty paying attention and/or retaining things doesn’t mean that
                    they can’t learn or are limited in their learning. In fact, being an ADHDer, only opens up more
                    doors to explore. 
                    <br>
                    ADHDers tend to process information slower than other people in order to
                    understand it at the level that is needed. And while this can sometimes be frustrating and take
                    time, it means that when going through something slowly, ADHDers can pick up on details
                    that are usually overlooked by others, make connections that are usually missed, and gain a
                    deep understanding of what task or topic they are completing/studying.
                    So even though a work project might be late, it's quality will be above expectations.</p>

                    energy inside my body. Before I took...before I found out, I was a lot...I was very
                    confused and was getting bad grades and struggling with school.
                    And after I found out and started taking the tablets, I was more fused into my work, concentrated
                    much better and proud to show people my assessments and tests."

                <p>"Inattentive ADHD is hard to live with, but it's also an amzing thing to have. Before diagnosis I was
                    yelled at by teachers, I struggled in school and was passed off as a "day-dreamer"
                    or "not willing enough to learn". But after diagnosis, I found an answer to why I worked the way I
                    did, and using that I have been able to get the support I need to excel (mostly) in school and life
                    like I
                    was always capable to do, but never got the chance to.

                    completely amaze you if you take the time to stop and look at them. It's all about working together
                    as a team and finding a balance between our differences. "

                    makes sense?
                    School is still stressful but it's more manageable with meds, it's slightly easier to understand
                    things. Often I can get concepts faster than others, especially in certain subjects, but then it's
