        <h1>Autism (ASD - Autsim Spectrum Disorder)</h1>

                <h2>What is it?</h2>
            </a>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Autism, or ASD (the new name), is not a disease or a mental illness; however, some Autistic people
                    could have additional mental health problems.
                    Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental ability, brought on by differences in
                    the brain. Simply put, it means that an Autistic person experiences the world differently, both in
                    how they see it and how they interact with it.
                    Autism impacts a person's thinking, feelings, social interactions, and perception of their
                    surroundings. It is a neurotype that a person has for the whole of their life, from birth until old
                    age.
                </p>
                <p>Some people with Autism have a recognised distinction, such as a genetic condition. Other factors are
                    still unknown. Autism is thought to have a number of underlying reasons that, when combined, alter
                    how
                    people typically develop. There is still so much to learn about these factors and how they affect
                    Autistic people.</p>

                <h2>The Autism Spectrum</h2>
            </a>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Each Autistic individual is unique. Because of this, autism is referred to as a "spectrum". There are
                    many different characteristics, so it can't be defined in a box. ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) is
                    the new term for all the different levels or characteristics on the autism “spectrum” (however, some
                    people prefer the name 'Autism'), including
                    what was formerly considered to be a separate diagnosis; Asperger’s Syndrome. Each person with
                    Autism
                    has a unique constellation of these characteristics.</p>

        <div class="article">
            <a id="Autism_brain">
                <h2>How does an Autistic brain work?</h2>
            </a>
            <div class="content">
                <p>In Autistic people, there are more variations in the brain. So let’s just do a quick biology crash
                    course: There are four lobes—frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal—within each half. Structures
                    that control everything from movement to thought are located inside these lobes. The cerebral
                    cortex, often known as grey matter, is located above the lobes. Information processing takes place
                    in this area. The cerebral cortex's surface area is increased by the folds in the brain.
                    More information can be processed the larger the surface area, or grey matter.
                </p>
                <p>Going into the more technical side of things, grey matter can form peaks and troughs, which are
                    called gyri and sulci. These creases and wrinkles might take diverse forms in Autistic people,
                    according to San Diego State University researchers. Particularly, there is much greater folding in
                    the right frontal and temporal areas of autistic brains, as well as in the left parietal and
                    temporal lobes.</p>
                <p>Because there are differences in the cerebral Cortex/the grey matter, in the brains of Autistic
                    people, the way they process information, view the world, and interact with it will be different
                    too.</p>

                <h2>Debunking the “dumb” myth</h2>
            </a>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The myth that Autistic people are unable to learn is just a plain lie. Unfortunately, some people
                    still believe that having Autism prevents their ability to learn, grow, and discover new talents and
                    skills. But remember, just because they learn differently or experience things differently, doesn’t
                    mean that they can’t learn anything. If we all learned and experienced things the same way, then
                    there wouldn’t be anything new to learn at all.</p>
                <p>Please learn from this or keep in mind that everyone's ability to learn is unique and that autism is
                    a spectrum, it's not set to specific abilities. Understanding a person's requirements, skills, and
                    learning style is essential while
                    educating someone, especially someone who's neurodivergent, as we might need some more sepcific
                    support needs, in order to have a fair chance to do our best.
                    To reach the same degree of learning, people with Autism may need additional specific support needs,
                    although some people might not. Some could be even easier to teach
                    than allistic people. Autistic individuals who struggle with learning can also benefit
                    from and advance through effective and qualified supporting courses, set at their own pace. Below
                    are some
                    strengths that Autistic people usually have:
