        <h1>Dyslexia</h1>
        <p>By Cie Buckland</p>


        <div class="article">
            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Dyslexia is not a disease! Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental ability where people have difficulty
                    reading or writing symbols and characters, as words and letters on the page can seem distorted or to
                    be swimming in the air (for most dyslexic people, but there can be other traits too!). </p>

                <p>Dyslexic people usually have trouble with single-word reading networks that are rooted in the
                    brain. Comprehension is not impacted by dyslexia. When reading related text, people with dyslexia
                    are able to use higher language abilities to "compensate," which might effectively hide their struggles with single-word reading (decoding).
                    <br>
                    The main challenge for a person with dyslexia is to decode—or translate—letter symbols into their
                    proper sounds and to spell—or translate—sounds into their proper written symbols. Poor visual (i.e.,
                    orthographic) coding may also contribute to the challenge, according to research on the subtypes of
                    dyslexia.

            <h2>Dyslexia doesn't have "set" traits</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>​​Dyslexia is not limited to one kind; there is a range of dyslexia types, and
                    no two people with dyslexia are alike. However, for dyslexic people, when given the right training
                    or support tailored to their learning
                    requirements, the majority can overcome their reading challenges or find a different angle to
                    approach them (eg. a of mine friend finds that putting a red plastic film over any text that they're
                    reading, stops the words from floating off the page), and go on to have successful lives.

            <h2>How does a Dyslexic brain work?</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Differently from most people, dyslexic people process information differently in their
                    brains. They share this characteristic with ADHDers, those who are highly gifted, people with
                    dyscalculia (trouble reading and writing numbers), and people who have PDD-NOS.</p>

                <p>The majority of people mostly use the left hemisphere of the brain when they think, whereas dyslexic people primarily use their right hemisphere. 
                    This results in a distinctive way of thinking and learning that is referred to as conceptual thinking.</p>
                    
                <p>Conceptual thinkers analyse hypothetical scenarios, patterns, and/or abstract concepts, helping to
                    create connections, fresh insights, and being able to observe the greater picture at hand.
                    This viewpoint was created through years of working with dyslexic adults and is based on
                    beliefs regarding image thinking. This viewpoint is becoming more popular throughout the world, and
                    numerous American research investigations have supported it.

            <h2>Thinking with the Right Hemisphere of the Brain</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>For thinking and information processing in dyslexics, the right hemisphere is predominant, meaning
                    that there is a
                    clear preference for using the right hemisphere when thinking. We argue
                    that just as some individuals struggle with painting, music, or math, for instance, someone who is
                    dyslexic has a natural difficulty processing words.</p>

            <h2>Debunking the “dumb” myth</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>When talking about dyslexic people who have difficulty in school, as a society, it’s become an idea
                    that those people are dumber than most or are not as intelligent or smart. But let me tell you that
                    that is completely, 100 percent, not true.
                    Just because dyslexic people have difficulties in reading or writing, doesn’t mean that they’re dumb
                    or can’t learn.</p>

                <p>Many people who are dyslexic go on to be successful in life, whether academically,
                    athletically, or expressively. And yes, school might not be their thing (neurodivergent and
                    neurotypical people alike), but that doesn’t automatically mean that dyslexic people are dumb.
                    They just think in a different way and might need just a bit more time.</p>

                <p>Listed in the article below are a few strengths that dyslexic people usually have:

                <p>Did you know that Albert Einstein was dyslexic? Yup! The famous physicist was dyslexic, which meant
                    that even though he struggled with words sometimes, his strong problem-solving skills (a strength
                    associated with dyslexia) only pushed him towards the significant contributions he made to quantum
                    physics (thus modern physics) and his theory of relativity.</p>
