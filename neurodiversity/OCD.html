        <h1>OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder)</h1>
        <p>By Cie Buckland</p>


        <div class="article">
            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p> NOTE: I have chosen to include OCD in this website because even though it's not a neurodiverse
                    condition, but is actually an anxiety disorder, it does share some overlapping traits with ADHD, and has been found to be connected to
                    Autism.

                <p>
                    OCD is not a personality quirk! Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition
                    that
                    is recognised by patterns of unpleasant thoughts or fears (obsessions) that cause you to engage in
                    repetitive behaviour.
                    These compulsive thoughts and behaviours disrupt daily life and can cause
                    distress.
                </p>
                <p>People with OCD might try to suppress or dismiss their obsessions, but doing so simply makes them
                    feel more stressed and anxious. Eventually, they carry out the obsessive behaviours again in an
                    effort to reduce their stress.
                    Even if attempts are made to push down or dismiss unwanted thoughts or desires, they persist. This
                    feeds the OCD cycle, which results in more obsessive behaviour.

        <div class="article">
            <h2>What might these obsessions look like?</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>OCD is often based around or centred on a certain theme, such as an obsessive fear of germs and
                    contamination. If so, people with OCD might excessively wash their hands until they're sore and
                    chapped in an effort to try and calm the fear surrounding germs and infection.
                    Another theme might be the need to have objects arranged in a particular order; otherwise, the
                    person might experience intense stress or upset. To try and quell this stress, they might
                    re-organise the objects into the order that they need them to be.

            <h2>How does an OCD brain work?</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>According to research, OCD is characterised by differences in brain connection and communication
                    between
                    the frontal lobe and deeper brain areas. The neurotransmitter serotonin, or chemical messenger, is
                    used by these brain regions.
                    According to studies, people with OCD exhibit excessive brain activity in the orbitofrontal cortex
                    (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which may account for their intrusive thoughts and
                    elevated anxiety levels, respectively.
                    <br>
                    Images of the brain in action also demonstrate that cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) or serotonin
                    reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) may help some individuals rehabilitate the brain circuits associated with
                    OCD.

            <h2>Debunking the “I’m so OCD” myth</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Please keep in mind that when talking about OCD or any other mental health condition, be very careful
                    about taking it lightly or joking about it. Unfortunately, it’s become common in society to say “I
                    have OCD about that”, when something in your environment is not to your liking.
                    <br>
                    This can be quite disrespectful and degrading to those who truly have OCD, as it's a very real
                    mental health condition,
                    and it should not be taken lightly. No one has part-time OCD about the little thing(s) that annoy them; it 
                    might be a pet peeve, but it’s not OCD.

                </p>
                <p>OCD is a serious mental health condition that affects roughly 3 percent of Australia’s
                    population alone, or around 791,127 people, and it has nothing to do with someone's personality or
                    personal attributes.</p>
                    
                <p>OCD stands for obsessive-compulsive disorder, and although many people might display obsessive or compulsive
                    traits, those who have been diagnosed with OCD are unable to "turn it off."
                    <br>
                    The brains of people with OCD are wired differently from those of people without OCD, according to
                    research. And as a result, OCD significantly affects their thoughts and behaviours, which can cause much distress in
                    day-to-day life.
                    And while it can cause stress for the person affected and those around them, there are also benefits
                    and strengths to having OCD. Below are a few strengths that people with OCD usually have:

                    personality, comedian, actor, producer, and “America’s Got Talent” judge, Howie Mandel.
                    Howie Mandel announced that he had been diagnosed with OCD in his forties on Monday’s episode of

            <h2>Treatment and Support</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is a form of anxiety, and the experiences of it are different for every person with OCD. 
                    People can have OCD and only require support to a certain degree, still being able to have a normal quality of life. 
                    However, some people's OCD is so severe that it can significantly impact their quality of life, consuming their daily life and become disabling. 
                    <br>
                    This is where treatment comes in, and depending on the severity, the treatment can be intense, minimal, long-term or short-term. 
                    <br>
                    Treatment for OCD may not cure it, but it can certainly help with managing symptoms so the anxiety and obsessions don't control the person's daily life.</p>
                    
                <p>OCD can be treated using a number of methods that include medications and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). One of the treatments that come under CBT is a treatment called 
                    'Exposure and Response Prevention (EPR)', which is where the person is slowly exposed to their object of fear or obsession. 
                    <br>
                    It can be great struggle and it takes a lot of effort and practic, but in doing this, it allows the person to develop ways and techniques to resist 
                    and manage the urge to carry out the compulsive tasks that usually quell their obsession or fear.
                    <br> 
                    This can help the person overcome their object of fear or obsession and overall improve their quality of life and daily living.</p>

                <p>Medications including certain psychiatric medications can and are also used to treat and manage OCD symptoms and compulsions in 
                    people, and they work by affecting various neurotransmitters in the brain, helping the brain to communicate better. 
                    <br>
                    Antidepressent medications (such as Selective Seretonin-Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)) are generally tried first to treat OCD in people. 
                    <br>
                    SSRIs work by boosting the levels of a brain chemical called 'serotonin' in the brain, which is a 'feel good' hormone. Serotonin regulates your mood and emotions, is used by your brain cells to communicate, 
                    and low levels of serotonin is thought to cause increased levels of anxiety and depression. By boosting serotonin in the brain, communication within the brain 
                    improves and levels of anxiety and depression decrease, overall reducing the severity of OCD symptoms and the anxiety and obsessions they usually entail.
                </p>

                <p>Learning support tools such as rest breaks and smaller examination groups for tests given by the school can also help in managing OCD for students. 
                    By doing this it can help reduce the OCD amplified stress and anxiety that usually comes with school work and assessments. 
                    It can make the schooling experience less stressful and overall improve the student's wellbeing and motivation to learn.</p>
